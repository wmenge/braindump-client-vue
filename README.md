Braindump Vue client
==================
Braindump is an alternative to [Evernote](http://www.evernote.com), born out of 
frustration as it is becoming more more locked down.
As I want to be in control of my own notes and bookmarks, I've
decided to take a shot at developing my own note takeing app.

This project contains a Vue based client for the [Braindump backend](https://github.com/wmenge/braindump-api).

See [Braindump API](https://github.com/wmenge/braindump-api) for the REST based backend API.
